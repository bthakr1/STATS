### Chapter 1
## Mean, Median, and Variance

```{r}
library(matrixStats)
state <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bthakr1/STATS/master/state.csv")

head(state)

# Mean of Population
mean(state[["Population"]])
# Mean of population with trimming on both end by 10%
mean(state[["Population"]], trim = 0.1)
# Median of Population
median(state[["Population"]])
# Weighted Mean of Murder Rate based on Population for respective state
weighted.mean(state[["Murder.Rate"]],w=state[["Population"]])
```

## Variability Estimates

Measures whether the data values are tightly clustered or spared out.

1. Deviation : Difference between observed value and mean estimate of location

2. Variance : Sum of Squared Deviation from the mean divided by n-1, where n is the number of observations

3. Standard Deviation : The square root of variance.

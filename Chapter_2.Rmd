*Sample* : Asubset of data from larger population.

*Random Sampling* : Drawing elements into a sample at random

```{r}

x <- 1:12

sample(x)

#With replace 

sample(x,replace = TRUE)

# With Probability

barplot(table(sample(1:3,100,replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.25,0.25,0.50))))

# Bernoulli's Trials

sample(c(0,1),10, replace = TRUE)

```

*Stratified Sampling* : Dividing the population into strat and randomly sampling from the strata.
